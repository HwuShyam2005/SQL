create table test(
  my_date date,
  my_time time,
  my_datetime datetime,
);

(FOR GETTING THE TIME)
insert into test values(current_date(), current_time(), now());

here,
current_date() is used for receiving the date in yyyy-mm-dd format
current_time() is used for receiving the time in hh-mm-ss format
now() returns the date and time together

(CHANGING THE CURRENT TIME AND NOW TO NULL AND CURRENT DATE TO THE NEXT DAY)
insert into test values(current_date() + 1, NULL, NULL);

(CHANGING THE CURRENT TIME AND NOW TO NULL AND CURRENT DATE TO THE PREVIOUS DAY)
insert into test values(current_date() - 1, NULL, NULL);
